# SWAG

This is a progam done in College in collaboration with other students. Instead of deleting it from my Github, I decided I would fix it up. The primary goals of this maintenance project:

1. Implement all intended functionality.
	This project didn't go well. Development was done in the span of 2 weeks and we didn't complete all of our intended functionality. Areas to improve (as of 4/20/21) - Flagging/Unflagging of suspiscious Gamblers, Manager Page functionality, manager registration of other users, Work Schedules, and Messaging System

2. Clean up any unused or incorrectly functioning code. This includes cleaning up the unused projects. In our defense, the unused projects were left in so that our Professor could see everything we've done. We decided to keep it painfully obvious instead of leaving trails in the commits.

3. Currently we have views and we have models. It would be good to put some kind of controller(s) in the middle instead of putting this functionality directly in the views.

4. Create consistency across the User Interface (positioning, size, etc.) and Enhance the design of the User Interface.

5. There is currently only one supported user at a time, and on the same machine. A nice to have feature would be to allow for modification of a data source from multiple machines. We would have to change the entire structure of the program so that we aren't reading everything into memory and are instead making query's and modifications on the data as needed.
